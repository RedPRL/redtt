Style and conventions
---------------------

We have no absolute rules, but try to adhere to the following:

- Generally use lowercase
- Keep line lengths reasonably short (< 90 characters)
- Write multi-word semantic units with hyphen (`is-contr`, `weak-connection`)
- Write subordinate semantic units with slash (`plus/assoc`, `symm/unit`)
- Reserve `is-` and `has-` for h-propositions (`is-contr`, `has-hlevel`)
