      ; this is suspicious: we use this Next in order to essentially
      ; weaken away the tick that we will not use, in order to get the right number
      ; of locks deleted. But this is proof-theoretically very strange.

; The proper solution to the problem above is to bind lock names in the syntax and in the context,
; analogous to tick names. This will make the calculus more baroque, but it will enable a
; deterministic version of the 'open' rule. The source term for the above would then be:
;
;     λ α → stream/cons (bool/constant x .0 α) (λ β → xs α)
;
; Above, α is a lock name and β is a tick name; opening with the lock α
; would *delete* the tick β from the context (thinking backward), which is
; a tick weakening. the example would typecheck because there is no need for
; β in xs.
;
; For reference, the core-language term would look like the following:
;
;    (shut [α]
;     (stream/cons
;      (open α (car (bool/constant x)))
;      (next [β] (open α xs))))
