# redtt.vim

This vim plugin requires Vim 8 (released September 2016).

## Use

While editing a .red file, run `:Redtt` or `<LocalLeader>l` (`l` for `load`) in
the command (normal) mode to check the current buffer and display the output in
a separate buffer. Run `<LocalLeader>p` (`p` for `partial`) to check the current
buffer, ignoring lines below the cursor's current position. The `<LocalLeader>L`
and `<LocalLeader>P` commands are analogous but use the `--ignore-cache` option.

### Typing special characters

`redtt` uses several unicode characters in its concrete notation; each of these
can be typed easily in the Vim mode using the `digraph` feature; alternatively,
they replaced with ASCII equivalents.

| Char | Digraph   | ASCII |
|------|-----------|-------|
| ùïÄ    | `C-k II`  | `dim` |
| ‚ä¢    | `C-k !-`  | `!-`  |
| ‚¶â    | `C-k <:`  | `<:`  |
| ‚¶ä    | `C-k :>`  | `:>`  |
| ¬´    | `C-k <<`  | `<<`  |
| ¬ª    | `C-k >>`  | `>>`  |
| Œª    | `C-k *l`  | `\`   |
| ‚Üí    | `C-k ->`  | `->`  |

## Setup

This plugin is compatible with Vim 8's package system. You can (re)install it by
running the following shell command from the current directory:

    ./install.sh

If the `redtt` binary is not in your `PATH`, add the following line to your
`.vimrc`:

    let g:redtt_path = '/path/to/the-redtt-binary'
